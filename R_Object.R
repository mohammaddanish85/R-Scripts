my_object= 1:10         # In this code we are simply creating an object named as my_object. 
                        # storing values from 1-10 as integers.
my_object               # Selecting this line and run, you will get an output printing numbers from 1-10.
                        # This object consists of a vector having length of 10.

plot(my_object)         # Plot function will plot the data in a 2 dimensional graph which can be seen in plot field.
